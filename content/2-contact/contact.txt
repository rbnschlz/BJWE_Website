About: My work explores the relationship between consumerist fetishism and copycat violence. With influences as diverse as Munch and Miles Davis, new insights are manufactured from both mundane and transcendant discourse. Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the endless oscillation of meaning. What starts out as hope soon becomes corroded into a manifesto of futility, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the unlikelihood of a new understanding.
